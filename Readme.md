This is a board puzzle solver that Andrew brought to work.

The puzzle consists of a board with 100 tiles, in a 10 by 10 config, and
12 pieces, each in a shape that's made from a different arrangment of 5
cells of the board. One has to place all 12 pieces such that none share
an edge with any other.
